# leaflet-challenge
Thanks to Stack Overflow, w3schools, Erin Wills, and Nathan Rosenberg for assistance. 

We use Leaflet to map a GeoJSON-based dataset of earthquakes over the past month, with markers indicating the depth, magnitude, and location of all tremors. A legend is provided for possible convenience.
